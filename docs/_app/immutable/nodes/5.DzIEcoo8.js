At Tofu Apps, we want to help you avoid the frustration that comes from fighting with the very tools meant to help you. We understand that ideas can surface quickly, and you donâ€™t want to waste any time jumping into a discussion. Thus, we made <a href="https://loci.ink" rel="nofollow">Loci</a>, and now you donâ€™t have to â€” meetings can be spontaneous!',H,m,N="Naturally, from the very beginning, we are therefore committed to <strong>fast, responsive real-time syncing</strong>. Strokes are rendered as they are drawn instead of only on completion, which you may experience with other whiteboard apps. Because laggy syncing is jarring and hinders your tracking of other collaboratorsâ€™ ideas, this is one key area that we are constantly striving to improve on. We want to provide you with the best collaborative drawing experience possible.",M,v,B='And thatâ€™s also why we have worked hard to ensure <strong>compatibility with all platforms via any modern browser</strong>.

Essentially, itâ€™s an efficient version of screen sharing that consumes much less bandwidth and helps you track other users as they draw and pan around, even across whiteboards in the same room (subject to access permissions, of course).
